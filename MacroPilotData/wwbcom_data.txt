WWB-COM: #EditingCert Comment
Syntax
'#EditingCert certkey ["prompt" [passphrase]]
Group
Declaration
Description
Alert: This comment is only available for use by WinWrap® Basic developers.

The EditingCert comment indicates that editing the current project/macro/module is protected with a Permission certificate.

Projects: A '#EditingCert comment in a project's module is ignored. The project itself contains the '#EditingCert comment for all the modules in the project.
The passphrase for Permission certificate 00000004 is "eval-perm". This certificate can only be used from WinWrap Director.
Parameters	Description
certkey	This Permission certificate provides the passphrase for editing. A successfully entered passphrase is cached for 5 minutes.
prompt	This text is used as the prompt when requesting the passphrase. If omitted the certificate's prompt is used.
passphrase	The remainder of the comment is used as the initial passphrase during the confirmation process.

WWB-COM: #EncryptingCert Comment
Syntax
'#EncryptingCert certkey ["prompt" [passphrase]]
Group
Declaration
Description
Alert: This comment is only available for use by WinWrap® Basic developers.

The EncryptingCert comment indicates that the current project/macro/module is encrypted with an Encryption certificate. Encrypting takes place when the current project/macro/module is saved.

Projects: A '#EncryptingCert comment in a project's module is ignored. The project itself contains the '#EncryptingCert comment for all the modules in the project.
A reference to the current project/macro/module can be protected by incorporating the certkey into the macro/module name.
'#Uses "SecureCode.bas/00000003"
This provides a high level of confidence that the referenced code (SecureCode.bas) has not been tampered with.
Encryption does not prevent users from viewing encrypted code. Use '#ViewingCert to do that.
Your application may not support script encryption. (The application's certificate must have the Encryption option.)
The passphrase for Encryption certificate 00000003 is "eval-enc". This certificate can only be used from WinWrap Director.
Parameters	Description
certkey	This Encryption certificate provides the encryption key. It also provides the passphrase for encrypting. A successfully entered passphrase is cached for 5 minutes. (The code can be decrypted and executed by using the Decryption certificate without a passphrase.)
prompt	This text is used as the prompt when requesting the passphrase. If omitted the certificate's prompt is used.
passphrase	The remainder of the comment text is used as the initial passphrase during the confirmation process.

WWB-COM: #Profile Comment
Syntax
'#Profile [MacroDir &] "filename"
Group
Declaration
Description
Each macro/module can collect profile information.
Parameters	Description
filename	Store the profile information in this file when the macro/module is unloaded. See File Format below.
File Format
The file has two sections: a line timing section and a procedure timing section.

The line timing section starts with a header line:
line <tab> hits <tab> direct-seconds <tab> total-seconds
Each macro line that required any time to execute follow with the line number in the raw text file, number of times the line was executed, direct and total execution times for the line in seconds. A blank line terminates the line timing section.

The procedure timing section starts with a header line:
first <tab> last <tab> hits <tab> direct-seconds <tab> total-seconds <tab> name
The next line provides information about the macro's hidden lines:
0 <tab> n <tab> 0 <tab> 0.000000 <tab> 0.000000 <tab> *HiddenLines*
where n in the number of lines not shown by the IDE. Each macro procedure follows with the line range in the raw text file, number of times the procedure was executed, the direct, total execution times for the procedure in seconds and the procedure name. A blank line terminates the procedure timing section.

In the future more sections may follow.

WWB-COM: #Reference Comment
Syntax
'#Reference {uuid}#vermajor.verminor#lcid#[path[#name]]
Group
Declaration
Description
The Reference comment indicates that the current project/macro/module references the COM type library identified. Reference comment lines must be the first lines in the macro/module (following the global Attributes). Reference comments are in reverse priority (from lowest to highest). The IDE does not display the reference comments.
Projects
A '#Reference comment in a project's module is a syntax error. The project itself contains the references for all the modules in the project.
Sandbox
Sandbox mode blocks this special comment.
Scriptable
An assembly with the Scriptable attribute only exposes types and members also marked with the Scriptable attribute. To avoid versioning problems the WinWrap® Basic assembly does not define the ScriptableAttribute. To make an assembly scriptable you must add the ScriptableAttribute implementation to your assembly and mark the assembly as Scriptable:
// C#
internal class ScriptableAttribute : Attribute
{
    public override object TypeId { get { return new Guid("542F6A10-6097-445A-B09E-A248863C2873"); } }
}
' VB.NET
Friend Class ScriptableAttribute
    Inherits Attribute
    Public Overrides ReadOnly Property TypeId As Object
        Get
            Return New Guid("542F6A10-6097-445A-B09E-A248863C2873")
        End Get
    End Property
End Class

Requires .NET 4.0 or higher.
Parameters	Description
uuid	Type library's universally unique identifier.
vermajor	Type library's major version number (hex).
verminor	Type library's minor version number (hex).
lcid	Type library's locale identifier (hex).
path	Type library's path.

Declaration
Description
Interface to a DLL defined subroutine or function. The values of the calling arglist are assigned to the params.

WARNING! Be very careful when declaring DLL subroutines or functions. If you make a mistake and declare the parementers or result incorrectly then Windows might halt. Save any open documents before testing new DLL declarations.

Err.LastDLLError returns the error code for that last DLL call.
Access
Public is assumed if access is omitted.
Pocket PC
Not supported.
Sandbox
Sandbox mode blocks this definiton.
Parameters	Description
name	This is the name of the subroutine or function being defined. If Alias "module name" is omitted then this is the module name, too.
"dll name"	This is the DLL file where the module's code is. If the DLL is in the same directory as the macro/module the expression MacroDir & "dll name" is allowed. This is the only expression other than a string constant which is allowed.
"module name"	This is the name of the module in the DLL file. If this is #number then it is the ordinal number of the module. If it is omitted then name is the module name.
The DLL is searched for the specified module name. If this module exists, it is used. All As String parameters are converted from Unicode to ANSI prior to calling the DLL and from ANSI to Unicode afterwards. (Use "Unicode:module name" to prevent ANSI to Unicode conversion.)
If the module does not exist, one or two other module names are tried:
1) The module name with a "W" appended is tried. All As String parameters are passed as Unicode.
2) The module name with an "A" appended is tried. All As String parameters are converted from Unicode to ANSI prior to calling the DLL and from ANSI to Unicode afterwards.
If none of these module names is found a run-time error occurs.
params	A list of zero or more params that are used by the DLL subroutine or function. (Note: A ByVal string's value may be modified by the DLL.)

Dialog Function
Description
A dialogfunc implements the dynamic dialog capabilities.
Parameters	Description
DlgItem	This string value is the name of the user dialog item's field.
Action	This numeric value indicates what action the dialog function is being asked to do.
SuppValue	This numeric value provides additional information for some actions.
Action	Description
1	Dialog box initialization. DlgItem is a null string. SuppValue is the dialog's window handle. Set dialogfunc = True to terminate the dialog.
2	CheckBox, DropListBox, ListBox, MultiListBox or OptionGroup: DlgItem's value has changed. SuppValue is the new value.
CancelButton, OKButton or PushButton: DlgItem's button was pushed. SuppValue is meaningless. Set dialogfunc = True to prevent the dialog from closing.
3	ComboBox or TextBox: DlgItem's text changed and losing focus. SuppValue is the number of characters.
4	Item DlgItem is gaining focus. SuppValue is the item that is losing focus. (The first item is 0, second is 1, etc.)
5	Idle processing. DlgItem is a null string. SuppValue is zero. Set dialogfunc = True to continue receiving idle actions. The idle action is called as often as possible. Use
Wait .1
to reduce the number of idle calls to 10 per second.
6	Function key (F1-F24) was pressed. DlgItem has the focus. SuppValue is the function key number and the shift/control/alt key state.
Regular function keys range from 1 to 24.
Shift function keys have &H100 added.
Control function keys have &H200 added.
Alt function keys have &H400 added.
(Alt-F4 closes the dialog and is never passed to the Dialog Function.)

Syntax
Get [#]StreamNum, [RecordNum], var
Group

Description
Get a variable's value from StreamNum.
Parameters	Description
StreamNum	Streams 1 through 255 are private to each macro. Streams 256 through 511 are shared by all macros.
RecordNum	For Random mode files this is the record number. The first record is 1. Otherwise, it is the byte position. The first byte is 1. If this is omitted then the current position (or record number) is used.
var	This variable value is read from the file. For a fixed length variable (like Long) the number of bytes required to restore the variable are read. For a Variant variable two bytes are read which describe its type and then the variable value is read accordingly. For a user type variable each field is read in sequence. For an array variable each element is read in sequence. For a dynamic array variable the number of dimensions and range of each dimension is read prior to reading the array values. All binary data values are read from the file in little-endian format.

Note: When reading a string (or a dynamic array) from a Binary mode file the length (or array dimension) information is not read. The current string length determines how much string data is read. The current array dimension determines how may array elements are read.

WWB-COM: JsonValues Object
Syntax
JsonValues
Group
Miscellaneous
Description
The ParseJson function returns a JsonValues object which is a simple wrapper for accessing the members of a JSON object or JSON array. The JsonValues object supports enumeration using For Each. Enumerating a JSON object returns each member as a JsonMember object. Enumerating a JSON array returns each array element.
JsonValues[.Item](Index|Name)
Get the value by numerical Index or by member Name. This is the default property. Empty is returned if the Index/Name does not exist. Indexing a JSON object by numerical index returns a JsonMember object. Accessing the array sequentially by ascending index (or with For Each) is efficient. For large arrays random access is not efficient. So, for large arrays copy the array values to a script array before processing further.
JsonValues.Count
This is the number of items.
JsonValues.Error(Index)
This is the string representing a parsing error (index=0 is the first error). If there is no error for the specified index then the result is "". (For example, if parsing the JSON encounters two errors then Error(0) is the first and Error(1) is the second. All other values for index return "".)
JsonValues.JSON
This is the string for the original JSON text.
JsonValues.HasMemberNames
This is True for a JSON object. It is False for JSON array.
JsonValues.MemberNames
This is the string array of member names of the JSON object.
JSON	Type Returned by Item when HasMemberNames is True
undefined	Empty
{...}	JsonMember
JSON	Type Returned by Item when HasMemberNames is False
undefined	Empty
null	Variant (Null value)
false	Boolean
true	Boolean

WWB-COM: MacroCompileAndRun Instruction
Syntax
MacroCompileAndRun MacroName$[, Command$]
Group
Flow Control
Description
Compile a WWB.NET/5 or WWB.NET/5+/Compiled macro and run it. Refer to all the additional considerations listed below. Execution will continue at the following statement after the macro has completed.
MacroRun
If the host application does not support the WWB.NET/5+/Compiled language the macro will be run as if the MacroRun instruction where used. If the macro does not have either the '#Language "WWB.NET/5+" or '#Language "WWB.NET/5+/Compiled" directive the macro will be run as if the MacroRun instruction where used. (If the default WWB.NET language is WWB.NET/5+ then the '#Language "WWB.NET" directive will also be compiled.)
Debugging
Compiled macros can't be debugged with the WinWrap® Basic IDE. Use the WWB.NET/5+ language and MacroRun when developing and debugging macros.
DoEvents
While executing a compiled macro no automatic UI co-routining with DoEvents occurs. If your compiled macro needs to allow the host application to process events insert DoEvents into the macro as needed.
Compiling
The Visual Basic compiler is used to compile the macro and it's '#Uses modules. Some language instructions, functions and extensions may not be available. The Visual Basic compiler will produce a syntax error for anything that is unavailable. Compiling produces a .NET/5+ library assembly. The macro's compiled assembly only exists in memory for the duration of the MacroCompileAndRun instruction.
'#Uses
When a macro is compiled all '#Uses modules (direct and indirect) are compiled as a single assembly. Each '#Uses module (direct or indirect) must use the '#Language "WWB.NET/5+" or '#Language "WWB.NET/5+/Compiled" directive. (If the default WWB.NET language is WWB.NET/5+ then the '#Language "WWB.NET" directive is also allowed.) The compiled Classes, Modules, Structures and procedures are not shared with any other instance of WinWrap® Basic.
CompileId
A macro/module has an optional CompileId attribute. The MacroCompileAndRun instruction uses it to determine if the macro/module has already been compiled and cached on disk as a DLL. This attribute's value is changed to a unique value by the WinWrap® Basic IDE whenever the macro/module is modified.
DLL Caching
DLL Caching only occurs if the macro and every '#Uses module (direct and indirect) each has a CompileId attribute. The macro's CompileId and all of the '#Uses modules' CompileIds are combined to determine if the assembly has previously been compiled and cached on disk as a DLL. If so, recompiling is avoid by loading the assembly from the cached DLL. Cached DLLs are not shared with any other instance of the WinWrap® Basic interpreter.
Sandbox
Sandbox rules are enforced through static analysis prior to compiling the assembly. (A syntax check also enforces the Sandbox rules.)
Parameters	Description
MacroName$	Compile and run the macro named by this string value.
Command$	Pass this string value as the macro's Command$ value.
Relative Paths
A relative macro name is a relative to the current drive's current directory. If the macro name is a special name (starts with '*') then its path is relative to the macro that is executing.

WWB-COM: Object Module
Group
Declaration
Description
An object module implements an object.
Has a set of Public procedures accessible from other macros and modules.
These public symbols are accessed via the name of the object module or an object variable.
Public Consts, Types, arrays, fixed length strings are not allowed.
Has an optional Private Sub Object_Initialize which is called when an instance is created.
Has an optional Private Sub Object_Terminate which is called when an instance is destroyed.
An object module is similar to a class module except that one instance is automatically created. That instance has the same name as the object module's name.
To create additional instances use:
Dim Obj As objectname
Set Obj = New objectname

WWB-COM: Operators Overview
Syntax
^ Not * / \ Mod + - << >> & < <= > >= = <> Is IsNot
And AndAlso Or OrElse Xor Eqv Imp
Description
These operators are available for numbers n1 and n2 or strings s1 and s2. If any value in an expression is Null then the expression's value is Null. The order of operator evaluation is controlled by operator precedence.
Operator	Description
- n1	Negate n1.
n1 ^ n2	Raise n1 to the power of n2.
n1 * n2	Multiply n1 by n2.
n1 / n2	Divide n1 by n2.
n1 \ n2	Divide the integer value of n1 by the integer value of n2.
n1 Mod n2	Remainder of the integer value of n1 after dividing by the integer value of n2.
n1 + n2	Add n1 to n2.
s1 + s2	Concatenate s1 with s2.
n1 - n2	Difference of n1 and n2.
n1 << n2	Shift n1 by n2 bits to the left. The number of bits to shift is indicated by the lowest bits of n2: lowest 3 bits when n1 is a SByte/Byte value, lowest 4 bits when n1 is a Integer/UInteger value, lowest 5 bits when n1 is a Long/ULong value, lowest 6 bits when n1 is a Huge_/UHuge_ value. This language element is not VBA compatible.
n1 >> n2	Shift n1 by n2 bits to the right. The number of bits to shift is indicated by the lowest bits of n2: lowest 3 bits when n1 is a SByte/Byte value, lowest 4 bits when n1 is a Integer/UInteger value, lowest 5 bits when n1 is a Long/ULong value, lowest 6 bits when n1 is a Huge_/UHuge_ value. (For signed numbers the sign bit is propagated to the right.) This language element is not VBA compatible.
s1 & s2	Concatenate s1 with s2.
n1 < n2	Return True if n1 is less than n2.
n1 <= n2	Return True if n1 is less than or equal to n2.
n1 > n2	Return True if n1 is greater than n2.
n1 >= n2	Return True if n1 is greater than or equal to n2.
n1 = n2	Return True if n1 is equal to n2.
n1 <> n2	Return True if n1 is not equal to n2.
s1 < s2	Return True if s1 is less than s2.
s1 <= s2	Return True if s1 is less than or equal to s2.
s1 > s2	Return True if s1 is greater than s2.
s1 >= s2	Return True if s1 is greater than or equal to s2.
s1 = s2	Return True if s1 is equal to s2.
s1 <> s2	Return True if s1 is not equal to s2.
Not n1	Bitwise invert the integer value of n1. Only Not True is False.
n1 And n2	Bitwise and the integer value of n1 with the integer value n2.
n1 AndAlso n2	Logical and of n1 with the n2. If n1 is False, n2 is not evaluated. This language element is not VBA compatible and requires the #Language "WWB-COM" setting.
n1 Or n2	Bitwise or the integer value of n1 with the integer value n2.
n1 OrElse n2	Logical or of n1 with the n2. If n1 is True, n2 is not evaluated. This language element is not VBA compatible and requires the #Language "WWB-COM" setting.
n1 Xor n2	Bitwise exclusive-or the integer value of n1 with the integer value n2.
n1 Eqv n2	Bitwise equivalence the integer value of n1 with the integer value n2 (same as Not (n1 Xor n2)).
n1 Imp n2	Bitwise implicate the integer value of n1 with the integer value n2 (same as (Not n1) Or n2).

Group
Declaration
Description
User defined property. The property defines a set of statements to be executed when its value is used or changed. A property acts like a variable, except that getting its value calls Property Get and changing its value calls Property Let (or Property Set). Property Get and Property Let with the same name define a property that holds a value. Property Get and Property Set with the same name define a property that holds an object reference. The values of the calling arglist are assigned to the params. (For Property Let and Property Set the last parameter is the value on the right hand side of the assignment operator.)
Access
Public is assumed if access is omitted.

WWB-COM: Put Instruction
Syntax
Put [#]StreamNum, [RecordNum], var
Group
File
Description
Write a variable's value to StreamNum.
Parameters	Description
StreamNum	Streams 1 through 255 are private to each macro. Streams 256 through 511 are shared by all macros.
RecordNum	For Random mode files this is the record number. The first record is 1. Otherwise, it is the byte position. The first byte is 1. If this is omitted then the current position (or record number) is used.
var	This variable value is written to the file. For a fixed length variable (like Long) the number of bytes required to store the variable are written. For a Variant variable two bytes which describe its type are written and then the variable value is written accordingly. For a user type variable each field is written in sequence. For an array variable each element is written in sequence. For a dynamic array variable the number of dimensions and range of each dimension is written prior to writing the array values. All binary data values are written to the file in little-endian format.

Note: When a writing string (or a dynamic array) to a Binary mode file the string length (or array dimension) information is not written. Only the string data or array elements are written.
